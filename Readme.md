Event Volunteer Assignment System (Python Full-Stack)
A dynamic, full-stack web application designed to streamline the process of managing and assigning event volunteers. This system uses a smart priority algorithm to rank volunteers based on their experience and availability, ensuring the most qualified individuals are assigned first. The application features an interactive frontend and a robust Python/Flask backend with persistent data storage.

‚ú® Key Features
üß† Smart Prioritization: Automatically calculates a priority score for each volunteer (60% experience + 40% availability).

üñ•Ô∏è Interactive UI: A clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface for adding volunteers and visualizing the priority queue.

üíæ Persistent Data Storage: Your data is saved! The Python backend stores all volunteer information in a JSON file, so nothing is lost.

üöÄ Full-Stack Architecture: A clear and scalable separation between the frontend (HTML/CSS/JS) and the backend (Python/Flask).

‚úÖ Real-time Updates: The interface instantly reflects changes made, providing a seamless user experience.

üìù RESTful API: A well-defined API for managing volunteer data.

üöÄ Project Implementation Guide
Follow these steps carefully to get the project running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

Python 3.8+: Download Python

pip (Python's package installer, usually comes with Python)

A modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge)

Step 1: Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine using Git.

git clone [https://github.com/Bellamkonda-Nokesh/Event-Volunteer-Python-Fullstack.git](https://github.com/Bellamkonda-Nokesh/Event-Volunteer-Python-Fullstack.git)
cd Event-Volunteer-Python-Fullstack

Step 2: Backend Setup & Launch
The backend server must be running before you can use the application.

Navigate to the Backend Directory:

cd backend
Create and Activate a Virtual Environment: This creates an isolated environment for your Python packages, which is a best practice.

On macOS/Linux:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

On Windows:

python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

Your terminal prompt should now be prefixed with (venv).

Install Required Packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Flask Server:

python app.py

The backend server is now running and listening on http://localhost:5000. You will see output in the terminal. Keep this terminal window open.

Step 3: Frontend Launch
Open a new terminal window.

Navigate to the frontend directory from the project's root folder.

# Make sure you are in the root 'Event-Volunteer-Python-Fullstack' directory first
cd frontend

Open index.html in your browser. The simplest way is to find the index.html file in your file explorer and double-click it.

Congratulations! The application is now fully running. You can start adding volunteers.


üìã API Endpoints
The backend provides the following API endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| GET | /api/data | Fetches all queued and assigned volunteers. |
| POST | /api/volunteers | Adds a new volunteer to the queue. |
| POST | /api/assign | Assigns the volunteer with the highest priority. |
